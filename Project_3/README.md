# Project 3 

## Overview
System, which provides song recommendations based on the audio features of the songs. Content-based filtering focuses on describing a track by examining its content, in this case, its audio features, rather than user interactions or preferences.

The pipeline of this system is as follows:

&nbsp; Data Processing

&nbsp; K-means Clustering

&nbsp; Recommendation System



The pipeline of this system would be:

## Goal for Week1 - Week2
- Use a major Big Data system to perform a Data Engineering related task
- Example systems could be: (AWS Athena, AWS Spark/EMR, AWS Sagemaker, Databricks, Snowflake)

- Get data from Kaggle's Spotify open songs dataset
- Upload the processed data to AWS S3
- preprocess song's data and extract desired information
- Apply machine learning algorithms(such as K-means clustering) to analyze similarity and make predictions
