# Project 3 

## Overview
System, which provides song recommendations based on the audio features of the songs. Content-based filtering focuses on describing a track by examining its content, in this case, its audio features, rather than user interactions or preferences.

###The pipeline of this system is as follows:

&nbsp; Data Processing

&nbsp; K-means Clustering

&nbsp; Recommendation System 

## Data Processing
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Spotify open songs dataset.
The data is preprocessed to extract the desired information, such as audio features and other metadata.
The processed data is uploaded to AWS S3 for storage and easy access.

## K-means Clustering
Using the audio features of the songs, K-means clustering algorithm is applied to group similar songs together.
Clustering helps in identifying patterns and relationships among the songs, making it easier to provide recommendations.

## Recommendation System
The recommendation system utilizes the clusters generated by the K-means algorithm to provide recommendations.
When a user inputs a list of songs, the system calculates the mean vector of the audio features for the input songs.
Based on the mean vector, the system finds the cluster to which the mean vector belongs.
The recommendation system then provides a list of songs from the identified cluster, which are similar to the input songs.




The pipeline of this system would be:

## Progess I Made
- Getting familiar with SageMaker and S3
- Get data from Kaggle's Spotify open songs dataset
- Upload the processed data to AWS S3
- preprocess song's data and extract desired information
- Apply machine learning algorithms(such as K-means clustering) to analyze similarity and make predictions
