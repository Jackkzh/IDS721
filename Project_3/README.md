## Goal for Week1 - Week2
- Use a major Big Data system to perform a Data Engineering related task
- Example systems could be: (AWS Athena, AWS Spark/EMR, AWS Sagemaker, Databricks, Snowflake)

- Get data from Kaggle's Spotify open songs dataset
- Upload the processed data to AWS S3
- preprocess song's data and extract desired information
- Apply machine learning algorithms(such as K-means clustering) to analyze similarity and make predictions
