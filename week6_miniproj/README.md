# Week 6 - A Rust holiday Info app

## Overview

This week I built a Rust program that can give information of nearestÂ incoming US holidays based on a date a user provide. The program fetch US holidays data from a public API. It then reads a date input by the user, and give out the 5 incoming holidays information which are about to come. 

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jackkzh/IDS721.git

cd week6_miniproj/holidayapp/src

cargo run

YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2023-03-15)
```
